Overview
This project simulates heredity to predict the probability of genetic traits being passed from parents to offspring. It uses Bayesian networks to model the inheritance patterns of genes and traits.

Features
Input: Family data including names, parents, and traits.
Output: Probability distributions for each person's genetic traits.
Customizable Parameters: Probability distributions for gene inheritance and trait expression.

Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
